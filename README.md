# web-excel

In this project I have created a web application for the Users to upload excel files and displaying them in table format. 
So, for the web application I've used "Streamlit" library using python for the implementation. I've implemented it in Google Colab by writing the cell as '.py' extension and that code is uploaded as 'project.py' in this repository.
And then I ran the program using npx localtunnel, then by clicking on the url we got - it displayed the web app in the next tab. In that we can use the web application.

For installing Streamlit I've used the command:  
!pip install streamlit -q   

To run the program and get the url of the web page: 
!streamlit run project.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501


Go to the url of: "your url is: ".


The sample demo of the web application is uploaded in the repository.
